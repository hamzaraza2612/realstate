## Milestone 1 — Foundation ✅
- [x] Repo/docs scaffold
- [x] Backend solution (`backend/RealEstateErp.sln`) with Api/Application/Domain/Infrastructure/Shared
- [x] PostgreSQL EF Core setup + initial migration
- [x] Tenant model + `ITenantContext` + global query filters (+ explicit Super-Admin-only bypass)
- [x] ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT access/refresh tokens (rotating, hashed at rest)
- [x] Permission-based RBAC (Roles, Permissions, RolePermissions) — 17 system roles seeded per spec
- [x] Organization (tenant) CRUD + Super Admin bootstrap + Subscription Plan CRUD
- [x] Audit logging (automatic diff-based via DbContext + explicit `IAuditLogger` for business events)
- [x] Global error handling middleware + ProblemDetails
- [x] Serilog structured logging
- [x] Swagger/OpenAPI with JWT auth
- [x] IP rate limiting (AspNetCoreRateLimit) — tighter limits on `/auth/login` and `/auth/refresh`
- [x] Frontend shell (Vite+React+TS+Tailwind+Radix "shadcn-style" components): login, dashboard,
      sidebar/topbar/breadcrumbs, dark mode, Users/Roles/Organization/Audit Logs pages, Super Admin
      Platform pages (Organizations, Subscription Plans) — verified in a real browser end-to-end
- [x] Docker Compose (Postgres, Redis, API, Web, reverse-proxy Nginx) + `.env.example` +
      per-service Dockerfiles — API image built and run end-to-end against real Postgres in this
      session; full `docker compose up` could not be exercised here because this sandbox's network
      policy blocks Docker Hub image pulls (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- [x] Seed script: Super Admin + demo organization (`acme-builders`) with demo users per role
- [x] Unit/integration tests: 12 unit + 13 integration (real Postgres, real HTTP pipeline) covering
      login, refresh rotation, tenant isolation, and RBAC enforcement — all passing

## Notes on scope realism
This is a genuinely large, multi-quarter product (50 functional areas). Each
milestone above ships real, persisted, tested functionality rather than
scaffolding — so later milestones (Construction, Property/Rental, Facility,
SaaS billing) will each take substantial follow-on sessions. The foundation in
Milestone 1 is built so every later module plugs in without rework: tenant
isolation, permission checks, audit logging, validation pipeline, and API/DTO
conventions are established once and reused everywhere.
